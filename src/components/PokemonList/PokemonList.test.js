/**
 *
 * Could use snapshot testing (carefully).
 * In addition one could shallow render PokemonList and:
 *      - verify that Pokemon component is rendered when category=wild
 *      - verify that PokemonWithInfo component is rendered when category!=wild
 *      - verify that the css classes attached to the html elements are as expected
